{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"creating-this-site","contentHtml":"<p>This is my first foray in to using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.JS</a> so I will be documenting the process as I add more features to the site</p>\n<h2>Phase 1 - The MVP</h2>\n<p>The Next.JS team have some good <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app\">documentation</a> for beginners. Specifically, how to set up a new static hosted web app which is perfect for me at this stage</p>\n<p>I decided to host the <a href=\"https://github.com/R467/R467.github.io\">project</a> on Github as an excuse to use both Github Actions and Github Pages</p>\n<h3>Github Pages and Github Actions</h3>\n<p>To create your github.io create a repo with the specific name format. I won't go in to detail there is plenty of documentation out there\n<img src=\"/images/creating-this-site/GithubPagesRepoName.png\" alt=\"Github repo name is R467/R467.github.io\"></p>\n<p>Be sure to select \"gh-pages\" as that will be the default branch for the exported content\n<img src=\"/images/creating-this-site/GithubPagesPublishFolder.png\" alt=\"Selected branch is gh-pages and root folder\"></p>\n<p>Rather that reinvent the wheel I have borrowed the template for my action from <a href=\"https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action\">JamesIves</a></p>\n<p>You can see the action <a href=\"https://github.com/R467/R467.github.io/blob/bbd7e5905069375eeb8a0d34e0882454309ab4b2/.github/workflows/main.yml\">here</a></p>\n<h3>Images and static rendering</h3>\n<p>Next.JS has a handy component for <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image\">image rendering</a></p>\n<p>By default it support dynamically resizing images to reduce their size. The problem for me it that it doesn't support exported (i.e static) content.\nThe short-term workaround for this is to use a vanilla <code>&#x3C;img></code> tag instead</p>\n<p>There are options to resize images through packages such as https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images</p>\n<p>I've briefly tried to make this work without success. Looking ahead, this site probably won't stay as static site so for now I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole</p>\n<h3>Rendering images from markdown</h3>\n<p>I'm using remark for rendering for markdown so with <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-images\">this</a> package I can extend that to include images in the output</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>At this point in time I have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Github repo</li>\n<li>Github action used to export and deploy the site to Github pages</li>\n<li>Pages being published from markdown</li>\n<li>Static content</li>\n</ul>\n","title":"Creating this site - Part 1","date":"2021-11-26"}},"__N_SSG":true}
